I've been lonesome, I've been empty
I got an achin' way down inside
I need someone, someone to hold me
Pull down the shade, turn out the light, and love me tonight

Don't think about tomorrow, it don't matter anymore
We can turn the key and lock the world outside the door
I need you so now, come on, let go now
Kick off your shoes, turn out the light, and love me tonight

Now don't you worry, we're all alone now
Let your hair down, sit by my side
Turn off the TV, put on some music
Pull down the shade, turn out the light, and love me tonight

Don't think about tomorrow, it don't matter anymore
We can turn the key and lock the world outside the door
I need you so now, come on, let go now
Kick off your shoes, turn out the light, and love me tonight
